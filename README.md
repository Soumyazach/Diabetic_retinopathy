The aim of the project is to detect Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a medical condition in which damage occurs to the retina due to diabetes mellitus.
It is detected by the presence of microaneurysms, small saccular outpouching of capillaries, retinal hemorrhages, ruptured blood vessels—among other features—on the fundoscopic images
Manual grading by ophthalmologists is done by  identifying diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus photographs, which requires skilled labor and is time consuming. 
A chronic eye disease that affects 80% of those who had diabetics for 20 years or more.
Nearly 415 million diabetic patients at risk worldwide.
Deep learning artificial neural network approach, can achieve high sensitivity and specificity in detecting the referable diabetic retinopathy, defined as moderate or worse diabetic retinopathy.
